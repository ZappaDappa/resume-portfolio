    <h2>What You Need Said: Online, On-Air, and On Paper.</h2>
    <h3>Technical clarity. Creative storytelling. Content that speaks.</h3>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m Caleb McMillan—a freelance writer and communication strategist with deep roots in media, marketing, and technical documentation. From SEO blogs and white papers to press releases and radio scripts, I help businesses and broadcasters craft content that connects, converts, and informs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bring over a decade of professional writing experience, formal training in technical communication, and hands-on knowledge of HTML, CSS, and UX. Whether I’m structuring docs in DITA XML, auditing a small business website for content and flow, or tightening copy for a 30-second radio spot, my goal is the same: clarity, impact, and user-first storytelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve been behind the mic, in the editing booth, and even out in the field as a beer rep for Howe Sound Brewing. At Studio 710 in Vancouver, I helped produce live shows, podcasts, and multimedia content. Skills I now bring to the radio world, where I’m as comfortable writing ad copy as I am troubleshooting tech or helping with social content.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need a versatile creative who can write, produce, pitch, publish, and polish—on air and online—let’s talk.
